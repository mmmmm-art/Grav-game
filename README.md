# Making Your First Phaser 3 Game

This exercise is based on the official "getting started" tutorial by Richard Davey. After forking this repository into your own GitHub repo and cloning it to your local machine, open the containing folder in VS Code and follow the step-by-step instructions found here: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1

## Differences from the official tutorial

The original tutorial has the JavaScript content embedded in the HTML file to keep the content together as you walk through the tutorial. Since we have been working with our JavaScript file as a separate app.js file, I have broken it out so you can continue to walk through the tutorial with a more familiar development pattern. I have included the "official" tutorial files in the `official-tutorial-files` directory for your reference.

You should be able to make changes to the `app.js` file based upon the guidance given in the tutorial, just keep this in mind as you are going through it.

Once you have completed the tutorial, your `app.js` file should look similar to the embedded JavaScript in the `official-tutorial-files\part10.html` file (lines 17 - 202).

## Getting to the Tutorial HTML Files

You may want to look at the official tutorial files in your web browser to see how it should look. You can navigate to these files once you have hit the "Go Live" button in VS Code, from the following links:
